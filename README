I have adhered to the honor code
This is my scanner/tokenizer for BPL
It's written in C++. Source files are in the src directory.
Relevant files to the scanner are

tokenizer.cpp,
tokenizer.h,
token.cpp,
token.h,
char_utils.h,
char_utils.cpp

To build the files, type "make"
To run the scanner, type "./bpl filename"
I have provided some test programs to test with in test/testFiles
